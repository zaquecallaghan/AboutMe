<h2>Taking A Break For Your Family</h2>
<p> The alarm went off: 5:00am. It was still dark outside, and Tyler never wanted to leave his wife this early, but he
    had to get up anyway. Interstate traffic had gotten so bad that leaving home three hours early was the only
    reasonable way to get to work on time. As he walked down the hall, he glanced into his daughter's bedroom. She was
    still fast asleep, with their cat curled up at the foot of the bed. In a few hours, she would wake up and go to
    school. He smiled sadly to himself as he went downstairs, knowing that he wouldn’t get to see her until late
    tonight. She had her extracurriculars every other evening, it seemed. By the time he got back home, she was on her
    way out again. It seemed that the three of them never got to see each other anymore.

<p> If this story sounds familiar, it may be because it’s a story that millions of families around the world have known.
    We lead busy lives, and it can take a toll on our families. Whether it’s soccer practice or after-school club
    meetings for the kids, PTA meetings or late-night assignments for the parents, or anything in between, families
    don’t get to spend as much time together as they would like. Work is stressful, and we look forward to being able to
    sit down and do nothing. It’s these little moments of spare time that really shape our families.
</p>
<p> When you think of the word “leisure”, what comes to mind? Beaches? Resorts? Lavish vacations? Star Trek movie
    marathons? (Okay, maybe that last one is just me.) The wonderful thing about leisure is that it means something
    different to everyone. Some people want a spa treatment at a beach resort in the Bahamas. I, myself, find theme
    parks relaxing. I have found that my heart rate actually drops when I ride thrilling roller coasters. That may seem
    counterintuitive but being on thrill rides distracts me from my normal, busy life and lets me relax. That is the
    important part: relaxing.</p>
<p> Life is stressful. School is stressful. Careers are stressful. Being in a one-way relationship where the only thing
    that seems to matter to the other person is the color of the drapes and even when you think you get it right it
    still ends up being the wrong one even though you consulted her multiple times and got what you thought was the seal
    of approval only to be told how wrong you were after the refund period expired…is stressful. And that stress can
    wear and tear on family relationships until people start to take out their frustrations on each other. </p>
<p> The time we spend on leisure can alleviate the pressure that we feel from the stresses of everyday life.</p>
<p> If the family is in danger from burn-out and stress, then stress to be faced as a family. That’s where family
    leisure comes in. Some people may object, thinking, “But I don’t have the money for a family vacation.” That’s
    understandable. Tourism industries have been marketing lavish vacations at premier destinations with the finest
    services as the crown jewel of leisure time. Don’t believe it. It is not true. Your leisure time will be best spent
    as you make memories together. If you have the money to shell out for one of these expensive trips, have at it. What
    happens to many people, though, is that they see these expensive trips and then overwork themselves in order to
    afford them. It isn’t the trip itself that makes the leisure time special. It’s about the time spent together.</p>
<p> Walt Disney famously told the story of a weekend he spent with his two daughters. The girls would ride the
    merry-go-round or other activities in the park while Walt would watch from the bench, eating peanuts. He wished
    there was a place where parents and children could have fun together. </p>
<p>Thus, the idea of Disneyland was born. Maybe the theme parks have gone a little astray from Walt’s original
    intentions to simply be a place for families to play together, but he was on to something. Walt knew the importance
    of spending time together, rather than simply spending time.
</p>
<p> As I wrote before, you don’t need to have elaborate vacations to enjoy leisure time as a family. Maybe instead, take
    an upcoming weekend and find a local park to go to. See a movie and discuss it over ice cream after. Dust off an old
    board game and get together for a few hours. Put aside the worries of your lives and just come together, even for a
    little bit. The activity isn’t important. Just do it together. A regular, consistent effort to be together will
    bring the family together in the end.
