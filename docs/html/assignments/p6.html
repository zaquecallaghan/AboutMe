<h2>The Festering Corrpution</h2>
<p>Amidst the plethora of evidence that would normally suggest that South Africa enjoys a highly successful democracy –
    complete with a booming economy, free press, and open government watch dogs – the country suffers from a large
    amount of political corruption that stems from the growing principal-agent problem inside the government itself.</p>
<p>South Africa has recently had a little bit of a struggle maintaining a balance between what it is that the
    politicians want and what it is that the people want. This is what is known as the principal-agent problem, where
    the principals in the aforementioned problem are the citizens of the community of South Africa and the agents are
    the politicians that represent those people. In many cases, however, it became apparent that the agents were not
    fulfilling the tasks that the principals would have them fulfill. Rather, they would go and further their own
    personal agenda, often at the expense of the people that they supposedly represent. Back in the 1950s, the South
    African politicians implemented a policy that came to be known as “apartheid” that demanded that the non-white
    community of South Africans would be forcibly separated from the white community. A series of land acts were passed
    requiring that the government “set aside more than 80 percent of the country’s land for the white minority” (2010).
    The segregation, coupled with the land acts, caused the people to engage the government with the only option left at
    their disposal: open resistance and rebellion. For the next three and a half decades, the non-white community of the
    South African people would participate in open protests and rebellions, both violent and non-violent until “the
    National Party government of Pieter Botha sought to institute some reforms, including abolition of the pass laws and
    the ban on interracial sex and marriage” (2010). It wasn’t until 1994 when a new constitution was established and
    the first coalition government was formed that had a non-white majority.

</p>
<p>The end of the Apartheid era was supposed to mark a promising regime change for South Africa, with regime referring
    to the overall administration that is spearheaded by the current president or leader and changes with each new head
    of government. By shifting from “the Afrikaner National Party [that] won the general election under the slogan
    “apartheid” (literally “separateness”)” (2010) to the government of Presidents Jacob Zuma, Thabo Mbeki, and the
    African National Congress, South Africa was promised that fighting corruption would become a priority (Onishi &
    Gebrekidan 2018). As an agent of the African National Congress, however, those leaders were not quick to weed out
    the corruption from within the new government. The principal-agent problem was not yet solved, however, as the South
    African people would be let down once again by a government that promised to represent the people and protect the
    interests of the public. A rising political figure,

</p>
<p>Mosebenzi Joseph Zwane, sold them on his latest deal: a government-backed dairy farm that they, as landless black
    farmers, would control. They would get an ownership stake in the business, just by signing up. They would go to
    India for training, all expenses paid. To hear him tell it, the dairy would bring jobs to the impoverished, help
    build a clinic and fix the roads (Onishi & Gebrekidan 2018).

</p>
<p>Unfortunately for those poor farmers, the promise that had seemed too good to be true turned out to be exactly that.
    The government used the dairy farm as a cover while “millions of dollars from state coffers, meant to uplift the
    poor, vanished in a web of bank accounts controlled by politically connected companies and individuals” (Onishi &
    Gebrekidan 2018).

</p>
<p>The problem with the current model of the government of South Africa is that it never truly transitioned into a
    proper democracy after the apartheid era. The deal itself was reached on more “Pyrrhic terms: The black majority was
    allowed to control politics, but much of the country’s economic resources, including land, has remained in the hands
    of white South Africans and a small group of other elites” (Onishi & Gebrekidan 2018). Without the economic and
    political authority being held by the same entity, then the principal-agent problem will never cease to exist. The
    non-white community was granted the political authority, but most were still poor following the segregation from the
    apartheid laws. The economic authority, on the other hand, was still firmly entrenched with the white elite. “White
    people, accounting for 8 percent, retain an oversize influence on the economy” (Onishi & Gebrekidan 2018). Even
    without the political authority, the white elite retained control over the non-white politicians that desperately
    needed financial assistance for themselves and their families. From there, the politicians accepted bribes and were
    offered shares of the white-owned corporations. The generous donations from the white elites were coupled with the
    promise that the priorities of the politicians would be to the corporations and their backers first, and then to the
    people second. Even though their first duty was to the people that put them in office, it became a necessity for the
    politicians to support their financial sponsors. If they did not, then they would risk losing their new wealth and
    falling back to the state of poverty that they were in during apartheid. The principal-agent problem was only a
    symptom of the larger problem at play. It was not perpetuated by the politicians, per se, but rather by the white
    elites who only pretended to give up their political power after the apartheid laws were repealed.

</p>
<p>The principal-agent problem is a problem that many countries have faced, but not many have successfully countered it.
    For South Africa to overcome this disconnect between what the politicians do and what the people want them to do, it
    would require an overhaul of the entire economic system. The solution would demand that the politicians stop being
    bought out by the white elites that currently control most of the economy. This would be a bold action for the
    politicians to take, especially given how dependent those politicians can be on the financial support of those
    corporations. The board of directors for the companies the politicians are allowed to sit on could pull the
    politicians’ shares of their respective companies, thus effectively stripping them of much of the wealth they have
    amassed over the years. The next step, should the politicians have the bravery to continue to challenge the
    established economic powerhouse that the white community has established there, could be found by following the
    example of Apple here in the private sector of the United States: “Apple’s new policy requires executive officers to
    hold three times their annual base salary in stock, and executives have five years to satisfy the requirement”
    (Worstall 2013). By adding the policy that Apple executives would have to hold a large amount of equity in the
    company itself, Apple ensured that the agents of the shareholders have the same interests as the principals. Now,
    what is good for the executives is good for the common shareholders, therefore the executives will now be
    incentivized to make decisions that are good for everyone and not just themselves. It would take some clever
    legislation, but the same principle could be applied to the government in South Africa. At this moment, the
    politicians in South Africa are victim to the rules of the game that give them different obligations to fulfill than
    the people they should be supporting. Perhaps the politicians could find a way to isolate themselves from the
    economic elite that currently pulls their strings and align themselves with the common people. If they could do
    that, then they could develop legislation that strengthens the overall economy rather than focusing on building up
    the bloated, corrupt corporations that all but own the government as a whole.

</p>
<p>South Africa has a tough political challenge ahead. It will not be an impossible one to overcome, but it is a
    difficult one that will need to be faced if the people are to face a secure economic and political future. Should
    the current government system remain as it is, the people of South Africa will continue to lack actual
    representation in the government about how to build prosperity for the entire country. Without representation, the
    principal-agent problem will grow until eventually the white elite once again gains the political control in South
    Africa. If that were to happen, then the non-white community would be back at the proverbial square one and the
    country could enter another era of laws and legislation that strongly reflect the premise of what was implemented
    during the apartheid era.
