<h2>The Anti-Responsibility Movement</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, April 5, the Oklahoma House of Representatives passed a new bill on the legality of abortions in the
    state. CNN reported that the bill “would prohibit abortions at the time when a physician can detect early cardiac
    activity in an embryo or fetus, which can be as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.” The bill provides a means of
    exception for medical emergencies as the exclusive justification for an abortion. TIME magazine, in conjunction with
    the Associated Press, noted that the bill parallels recent legislation passed in Texas. They reported that “the
    Texas law bans abortion once cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy, without exceptions
    in cases of rape or incest. Notably, the standards upheld by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints do
    provide possible (though not automatic) justification for abortions in the cases of rape or incest, or if there is a
    medical emergency. </p>
<p> Critics of the new legislation are concerned about the trend of anti-abortion bills being passed across the country.
    Fox News reported such concerns from Emily Wales, the interim president of Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes:
    “They are more focused on governing our bodies than addressing real crises, like the economic turmoil caused by the
    pandemic and rising maternal mortality rates.” Though this particular comment is a non-sequitur that fails to
    address the actual issue at hand, TIME got another piece of her argument: “These restrictions are not about
    improving the safety of the work that we do. They are about shaming and stigmatizing people who need and deserve
    abortion access.”</p>
<p>The two sides of this debate seem to be debating two different issues. On the one hand, critics use the arguments
    similar to those presented above to mostly draw the issue around the idea of self-governance. Mainly, those opposed
    to the bill believe that each person is entitled to be the sole governor of their own body. However, those who
    support the bill are not debating that part of the issue. Fox News reported a comment from Nathan Dahm, one of the
    state’s senators who supported the bill: "From my first day in office, protecting the unborn has been one of my top
    priorities." For those who support the restrictions on abortions, the primary objective is to protect those who
    cannot protect themselves. One side of the argument is the right to self-governance while the other side is about
    the sanctity of life.</p>
<p>Abortion has taken center-stage in the modern political landscape. ‘Pro-choice’ arguments have become quite
    prominent, but only by fighting a different battle than their opposition. The heart of the debate surrounding
    abortion is actually tied into the concept of personal accountability and responsibility. The phrase ‘pro-choice’
    has become a euphemism for ‘anti-responsibility’ in today’s society.</p>
<p> Before commenting on the ‘anti-responsibility’ nature of the modern-day abortion, it is important to note the
    failures in the rhetoric of those who argue in favor of open abortion access. The arguments presented in the above
    description of recent events in Oklahoma are fallacious in nature. Arguing that this topic is not what ought to be
    discussed in the present moment, as Emily Wales has so argued, says nothing about the actual legislation in
    question. It is a deflection at best. Further, the continuation of her argument is what Scott Adams – an author in
    the field of persuasion – would call “mind-reading.” She claims that the lawmakers who passed the bill are focused
    on “shaming and stigmatizing people who need and deserve abortion access.” The inclusion of the words “need” and
    “deserve” are up for their own debate, but the nature of this comment is itself a claim to know exactly what other
    people are thinking and when. This, of course, is not possible, yet it is often used as a counter-argument against
    those who are against elective abortion. </p>
<p> The pro-choice movement would claim that to ban abortion would be to deny a woman her right to choose. However,
    there were plenty of opportunities for choices well before an abortion could even be a consideration. Other birth
    control options – more preventative in nature – could have been employed. Further, a couple who was adamant that
    they didn’t want to have a child together could have chosen to not participate in those sexual relations. At each
    point in the path, the individuals involved had to choose to participate in events that could lead to pregnancy and
    the conception of life (there are notable examples where the woman involved may not have actually had a choice, but
    that’s an entirely different debate). To claim that a woman needs to be able to choose to have an abortion is to
    render all of the choices made before meaningless. There were multiple avenues presented to turn away and not have
    to face the consequences of an unwanted pregnancy, but those were not taken. </p>
<p> Some have undoubtedly tried to justify an elective abortion because their precautions proved ineffective. They may
    argue something like: “It’s not our fault the birth control didn’t work!” With the understanding that no birth
    control procedure is one-hundred percent effective, it becomes the responsibility of the couple to accept the
    consequences for their own actions. When we turn to excuses, we lose control over our lives and become victims of
    our own making. Elective abortion creates an enabling avenue for the irresponsible, who chose of their own free will
    to take on the risk of an unexpected pregnancy, to avoid responsibility for this choice. Getting an abortion doesn’t
    erase the first choice. An unexpected pregnancy may be the result of a mistake, neglect, or perhaps simply bad
    fortune. But as the saying goes, two wrongs don’t make a right. </p>
<p> Finally, a critical point that is commonly excluded from the conversation about elective abortion is the inherent
    sanctity of life. A physical body is one of the highest gifts from God to help us achieve the promise that we can
    return to live with and become like our Heavenly Parents. Through Jesus Christ and His Atonement, this mortal
    journey can lead to that celestial reward. He died so that we could live. And yet we may flippantly deprive another
    of that life which Christ died to save, all so that we wouldn’t have to deal with the consequences of our own poor
    choices.  </p>
