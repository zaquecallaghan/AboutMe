<h2>Freedom of Speech on College Campuses</h2>
<p>It’s a story far too prevalent in today’s media: people being prohibited from speaking on college campuses based on
    the ideas that they share. Yet, the academia these students represent are perfectly content with their populace
    stripping others of their right to free speech, so long as the speaker is in opposition to their own views. By
    barring certain people from speaking, you are essentially deeming their ideas to be irrelevant. Even if you try to
    justify the act by saying that people will be offended by what the speaker has to say, restricting the people is
    equivalent to restricting the ideas that those in power disagree with.
</p>
<p>Another important fact to consider is that the right to speak publicly is not the same as forcing people to listen.
    Nothing is requiring anyone to listen to a speaker. Any action taken in response to the speaker and the ideas
    expressed is the responsibility of the listener and not the speaker. In the case of riots and protests that result
    in damages, the speaker cannot and should not be held accountable for the conscious acts of those listeners who
    vehemently disagree. Are there things that could be said and interpreted to be mean or offensive? Sure. However,
    someone saying something mean does not automatically justify a violent response. Even if you disagree with something
    someone says, they retain the right to say it. The actions taken as a result are not the speaker’s fault.

</p>
<p>The greatest protest you can make when it comes to a speaker you, along with others, may not agree with is to not
    show up. A speaker that has a low turnout proves that people don’t believe in what that person has to say. Likewise,
    a high turnout would prove that a lot of people do care about what the speaker has to say. With a violent protest,
    the result is undoubtedly illegal. There is nothing that justifies the destruction of another person’s property.
    Going back to the first amendment: the constitution protects “the right of the people to peaceably assemble.” Once a
    protest turns violent, the protesters forfeit their first amendment right.

</p>
<p>Even if you feel that the ideas shared are so extreme that they need to be forcibly suppressed, that doesn’t give you
    the right to break the law and expect a free pass. Speech itself can never be violent. Perhaps it can entice others
    to take violent action, but as former NJ Superior Court judge Andrew Napolitano stated, “If the [speaker] stood up
    and said something incendiary and encouraged the crowd to commit violence and there is time for someone to challenge
    it… then his speech is protected and he is not criminally liable for the consequences of his speech.” Should the
    speaker successfully incite violence in a crowd, he would be responsible. This however, is the exception and not the
    rule. The majority of speakers are not there with the intent of inciting violence in a crowd, and it is
    disrespectful to assume that they are by shutting them down prematurely.

</p>
<p>The restriction of free speech in any form is a slippery slope. If one person can be silenced based on their ideas,
    how long will it be before an entire line of thought can be deemed to be incorrect. Once a government is allowed to
    regulate what people say, it isn’t long before they justify regulating what people think. The day we allow our
    freedom of speech to be restricted is the day we surrender all our liberty.
