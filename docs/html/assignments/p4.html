<h2>The Broken Silence That Broke</h2>
<p>Since its viral inception back in October, the #MeToo movement has produced some undeniably stunning results through
    the exposure of the prominent and powerful men that have committed horrible acts of assault. Millions of assault
    victims have been able to band together to find solace from their shared traumas and to universally and
    unequivocally denounce the kind of behavior and mentality that leads to sexual assault.
</p>
<p>For one brief moment, these women did what not many people would have dared to do. Starting with actress Alyssa
    Milano, the women who remained in fear broke free of the Spiral of Silence and became a unified voice. They rejected
    the notion of staying silent out of fear that they be socially isolated. They rejected the idea that things would be
    okay if they just kept quiet. Instead, they broke free.
</p>
<p>But then that moment ended.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what was once a prominent tool for women to identify as victims of sexual assault turned into a
    McCarthy-style witch hunt to remove people from their prominent positions. Take the cases of actor Aziz Ansari and
    radio presenter Garrison Keillor. Ansari lost any good reputation he had as an actor for not picking up on subtle,
    nonverbal cues that wouldn’t have been necessary had the woman simply spoken up. Keillor was dropped by Minnesota
    Public Radio for an incident involving him touching a woman’s back as a gesture meant to comfort her.

</p>
<p>Rather than simply expose the existence of true sexual atrocities, the movement devolved into a forum that featured
    things that women found to make them uncomfortable. This is not by any means to downplay the actual, serious harm
    that some of these women have to go through. But many of the supposed offenses truly amount to very little when
    compared to the serious assault cases.

</p>
<p>A writer for the New York Times, Andrew Sullivan, had predicted a downfall like this as something of a moral panic.
    He wrote to the Times about the newly decreed offenses:

</p>
<p>“This chorus of minor offenses is on the same list as brutal rapes, physical assaults, brazen threats, unspeakable
    cruelty, violence, and misogyny.”

</p>
<p>The original movement focused on the horrible acts of violence taken against women who kept quiet so that they could
    keep their careers intact. They put everything of theirs on the line by speaking out against the system. This is how
    those brave women are repaid. What was once a lifeline for those undergoing some traumatic event is now the
    equivalent of a herd of sheep bleating about how they feel uncomfortable if a man is within a twenty-foot radius.

</p>
<p>Like many things in life, it would seem that history is repeating itself. This time, however, there’s a certain irony
    to the current state of the #MeToo movement. The movement was a break from the typical Spiral of Silence that keeps
    people from voicing their opinions out of fear that they weren’t in the majority with that opinion. This was proven
    to be false by the overwhelming response the movement received. Now the movement has been turned on its head and has
    thus become the very thing it had fought to be free of. For people who see the movement for what it has become – a
    witch hunt – the movement has turned into a Spiral of Silence against them. People opposed to the new goals of the
    movement are now helpless as the chorus of supporters rings louder.
