<h2>The Shape of Opinion</h2>
<p>February 14, Valentines’ Day, marked the 18th school shooting in just 45 days of 2018. Or, at least, that’s what the
    media would have you believe. While the headline is not technically false, it isn’t exactly true either. It makes
    yet one more example of how sensationalized the media has become while also promoting a certain agenda.</p>
<p>The concepts of sensationalism and agenda setting are very closely aligned. Sensationalism involves the story being
    altered in such a way so that it appears more shocking or interesting to the passing viewer. Agenda setting is the
    process of altering a story so that it fits the narrative that is being pushed. In and of themselves, neither
    require the story to be altered so it is blatantly false. Both tactics do inevitably sacrifice some of the truth of
    the story.</p>
<p>In the case of the shooting that recently happened at Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, NBC ran the headline
    of “18 Shootings on US School Campuses in 2018” with the introduction of how the scene of students fleeing with
    their hands up has become “iconic footage.” This headline has been sensationalized by attracting passers by with a
    shocking statistic. The headline also reflects the anti-gun agenda of the media by highlighting the frequency of
    shootings.</p>
<p>The reality of that statistic is not the reality that the news coverage of the Florida shooting implies. The Daily
    Wire ran an article that broke down the facts of these 18 “shootings” and how they aren’t what ABC, New York Daily,
    or other news outlets are suggesting that they are. The full analysis can be read here, but the facts of the cases
    show that the majority of these shootings did not involve any fatalities and only one of the incidents would be
    considered a “mass shooting.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems that sensationalizing the media is the only way that people will be interested enough in a
    story to hear about it. An equally shocking headline could have been: “17 People Killed in School Shooting” or
    something along those lines. Instead, they decided to go with the headline that shows that school shootings are
    common occurrences in the United States. This is where the agenda setting factor comes in. My suggested headline
    tells the facts of what happened in the story. The headline that was used tells its own story of how gun violence is
    a problem in this country. Both headlines can be viewed as accurate, yet the latter pushes a very specific motive.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most insidious power of the media is the power to ignore. Often times, we can see the examples of how
    news outlets alter a story to fit their specific bias. What we sometimes fail to see is how news outlets omit some
    stories that contribute to the whole so as to further emphasize their side of the narrative. The issue of gun
    violence is frequently hit by this tactic. Mass media outlets will run stories about another incident involving guns
    and how they are dangerous to society, implying that limiting or controlling guns will solve the issue.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the media will choose to ignore the stories that involve how guns can actually save lives. In
    Springville, Utah, a suspect began attacking a police officer after being removed from a clothing donation bin. A
    man by the name of Derek Meyer happened to be driving past and stopped to intervene. He pointed the gun at the
    suspect and demanded he stop, prompting the suspect to flee until he was eventually caught. The officer suffered a
    fractured eye socket from the exchange, but his injuries could have been severely worse. There are plenty of stories
    that show how guns can protect people, but the media insists on only covering the stories that show how guns kill
    people.</p>
<p>It isn’t that the media is dishonest or is outright lying to the public. But it is clear that these news outlets are
    using stories and headlines as a means of shaping opinions on a certain topic. Sensationalized media lends itself to
    tell a story based on what the producers of the media coverage want you to think. It is important to remember that
    the news media might not be telling you the actual story. Answers should fit the facts, not the narrative.</p>
