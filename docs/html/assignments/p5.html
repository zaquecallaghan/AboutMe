<h2>The Rhetorical Failure</h2>
<p>With the deadline on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Act (DACA) growing closer, the topic of immigration
    has surfaced as yet another growing rift between parties. There has been a lot of rhetoric from both sides on the
    issue of illegal immigration, but very little discussion. Interestingly enough, there appear to be three positions
    on the issue: The Democrats, the Republicans, and the Trumpeteers. While each position has its merits, there are
    significant drawbacks to any of the solutions proposed by each faction.

</p>
<p>The Democratic response to Trump’s four pillars as outlined in his State of the Union address was the typical
    response from them about any suggestion from the President. Between all the crying and tantrum-throwing, some of the
    concerns voiced over his plan are genuine problems with the plan, such as how much a border wall will cost. A
    $25-billion price tag is something that shouldn’t be taken lightly. Congress would have to find a way to finance the
    wall and the easiest way to do that would be to pass the bill onto the citizens. This would have serious backlash on
    the Republicans, especially on the heels of their sweeping tax reform. The last thing Congressional Republicans need
    is to prove the Democrats who opposed the tax plan right by raising taxes.

</p>
<p>Where the Democrat’s argument falls flat is in their appeal to sympathy. The talking point they often fall back
    involves painting Republicans as cruel and heartless for wanting to tear families apart. While, yes, a more
    structured immigration platform coupled with a stronger enforcement agency may result in people being removed from
    family members, it is important to remember that these people broke the law. On the local scale, each of the 50
    states has some form of “No Trespassing” law. Enforcing immigration law is the same as enforcing those same local
    laws. Criminal trespassing is defined as entering or remaining on property that you do not have the authorization to
    be on. In most cases, trespassing charges result in a misdemeanor; usually accompanied by fines or imprisonment.
    Illegal immigrants lack the proper authorization to be on the premises of the United States. So why should they be
    allowed to stay with no consequence when domestic citizens are punished for doing the same thing?

</p>
<p>Also, families of legal citizens are torn apart every day because one of the family members broke the law and was
    sentenced to prison. Would those same Democrats be able to stand up and defend the families of convicted felons
    saying that the felon should not be put in prison for the sake of the family? Common sense and rational thought can
    tell us that is not even a remotely just option.

</p>
<p>The Democrats also fight against the idea of ending the visa lottery program. For them, immigrants from all countries
    should be able to find refuge in the United States. To show why this could be a problem, let’s compare the United
    States to a prestigious university – Harvard, for instance. Allowing every immigrant to enter the country and stay
    would be like if Harvard were to suddenly announce that they would accept any and all applicants. Would there be
    people who would flourish and do great even though they may not have been accepted under the university’s original
    requirements? Absolutely. But the majority of the people who got in solely under the new program would not be better
    off, since they only continue to live the way they wanted to in the first place. The end result being that these
    people are no better off than they were before and Harvard looks the worse for it.

</p>
<p>Next is the Republican response to the Trump Immigration Plan. Most Republicans are supportive of the stronger
    immigration enforcement and the removal of the chain-migration and visa lottery programs. The conservative
    establishment voices their opposition to two parts of the plan: the border wall and the path to citizenship. Their
    problem with the border wall echoes the concerns of the Democrats over the price of the wall. As for their
    opposition to the path to citizenship, they remain stubborn in their refusal to allow those who came here illegally
    to stay here legally. The problem with this is in the alternatives. Either the illegal immigrants stay here
    illegally, they go through an amnesty or citizenship process, or they get deported. With both of the first two
    options deemed unacceptable by the establishment Republicans, the only option left is deportation. But with 1.8
    million illegal immigrants, deporting all of them would be a logistical nightmare that would accomplish little to
    nothing.

</p>
<p>Finally, the position of the group most loyal to President Trump, the Trumpeteers: “We completely agree with
    everything our wonderful President says!” Okay, maybe they don’t actually say that. But the sentiment still stands.
    The Trumpeteers accept whatever the President puts forth as fact and ignore everything else. This creates blind
    spots that hinder their judgement in how to best proceed in finding a solution to a given problem.

</p>
<p>Looking at each individual position on Trump’s Immigration Plan, it is easy to choose a side and firmly stand by it;
    our social media habits essentially force us to do just that. What this issue lacks – and needs most of all – is
    discussion. The media should be imposing its own dialogical ethics practices to facilitate the spread of
    information. If no one is willing to listen to another’s position, then no practical solution can ever be reached.
